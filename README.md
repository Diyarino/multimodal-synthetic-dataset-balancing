# Multimodal Synthetic Dataset Balancing

Deep neural networks perform well on clean, unimodal data (e.g., sensors, images, or audio). While multimodal data can enhance performance, real-world industrial settings often face data corruption (e.g., noise, blur, or sensor failures), leading to significant performance drops. Existing data augmentation techniques primarily focus on improving model generalization but fail to simulate realistic industrial scenarios. This repository provides **industry-specific augmentation methods** for **temporal and spatial data**, tailored for **multimodal fusion** in deep neural networks. Our approach:  Add commentMore actions

- Promotes **modality collaboration**  
- Strengthens **generalization** under real-world conditions
- Realistic industrial augmentation for **temporal & spatial data**    

Explore the code to implement these augmentations in your multimodal deep learning pipelines!  


### ðŸš¨ Anomaly Injection

The following image demonstrates sample augmentations from our pipeline, showcasing realistic industrial failure modes simulated in multimodal data. These include sensor noise injections, temporal misalignments between modalities, and spatial corruptions mimicking equipment degradation. Each example reflects common challenges encountered in real-world industrial settings. The failure injection is based on our pre-work [1].

### ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

* **Python** â‰¥ 3.6
* **PyTorch** â‰¥ 1.0 (CUDA support recommended for faster training)

We also recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to avoid package conflicts.

## ðŸ”— Multimodal Robot Kinematic Datasets

This repository provides access to three multimodal robot movement datasets, each including at a minimum the **camera** and **kinematics** modalities. For detailed descriptions of the datasets, data collection procedures, and experimental use cases, please refer to our paper [2]:
