# Multimodal Synthetic Dataset Balancing

Deep neural networks excel at processing **unimodal data** (sensors, images, audio), but real-world **multimodal systems** often face corrupted signals (sensor failures, noise, or coverage gaps). This repository contains a fuzzy regularization method** for deep multimodal networks that:  

- Dynamically adjusts feature importance based on **signal quality**  
- Compensates for sensor malfunctions/uncertainties  
- Works with **image + time-series data**  


### âœ¨ Fuzzy latent-space regularization


In the realm of neural networks, **target activations** represent the desired output values for specific neurons or layers, often reflecting the ground truth or a predefined ideal state. The primary objective of a loss function is to quantify the discrepancy between the network's actual activations and the target activations. By minimizing this loss, we guide the network to adjust its internal parameters (weights and biases) such that its computed activations increasingly approximate the desired targets.

As training progresses over multiple epochs, the loss function continually guides the weight adjustments. This iterative process allows the neuron's activations to gradually "converge" towards the predefined target activations for each class, thereby improving the network's ability to detect anomalies.

### ðŸ“¦ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

* **Python** â‰¥ 3.6
* **PyTorch** â‰¥ 1.0 (CUDA support recommended for faster training)

We also recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to avoid package conflicts.

## ðŸ”— Multimodal Robot Kinematic Datasets

This repository provides access to three multimodal robot movement datasets, each including at a minimum the **camera** and **kinematics** modalities. For detailed descriptions of the datasets, data collection procedures, and experimental use cases, please refer to our paper [2]:

Each dataset captures robot motion across various tasks and environments, providing synchronized data streams for machine learning and robotics research.
